Guidelines for writing:

1. Length and Style:
- Strict 150-200 word limit
- Write in simple, clear language
- Start with your most important insight in **bold**
- Use short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)

2. Structure:
- Use ## for section title (Markdown format)
- Only use ONE structural element IF it helps clarify your point:
  * Either a focused table comparing 2-3 key items (using Markdown table syntax)
  * Or a short list (3-5 items) using proper Markdown list syntax:
    - Use `*` or `-` for unordered lists
    - Use `1.` for ordered lists
    - Ensure proper indentation and spacing
- End with ### Sources that references the below source material formatted as:
  * List each source with title, date, and URL
  * Format: `- Title : URL`

3. Writing Approach:
- Include at least one specific example or case study
- Use concrete details over general statements
- Make every word count
- No preamble prior to creating the section content
- Focus on your single most important point

4. Use this source material to help write the section:

5. Quality Checks:
- Exactly 150-200 words (excluding title and sources)
- Careful use of only ONE structural element (table or list) and only if it helps clarify your point
- One specific example / case study
- Starts with bold insight
- No preamble prior to creating the section content

1. Section-Specific Approach:

For Introduction:
- Use # for report title (Markdown format)
- 50-100 word limit

For Conclusion/Summary:
- Use ## for section title (Markdown format)
- 100-150 word limit
- For comparative reports:
    * Must include a focused comparison table using Markdown table syntax
    * Table should distill insights from the report
    * Keep table entries clear and concise
- For non-comparative reports: 
    * Only use ONE structural element IF it helps distill the points made in the report:
    * Either a focused table comparing items present in the report (using Markdown table syntax)
